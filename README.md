This repo will contain all of my API projects, below will be a short description of each folder/project.

* NASA
    - This was a class assigned project to create a UI of our own that would incorparate an API(s) from NASA's available APIs.
    - I used the APIs APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Insight (Mars Weather Service) to give the user the two ability's:
        - to cycle through the last 7 days via BUTTONs which would in turn change the webpage background IMAGE to the APOD IMAGE from that day.
        - to be able to get the Sol, Max Temperature, and Min Temperature on Mars.
    - User also has the option to change the background IMAGE to any days IMAGE via a BUTTON that when clicked will produce a new SELECT and close BUTTON where the user can scroll and select a year, month and then day. The webpage background will then change to the APOD IMAGE from the select day.
