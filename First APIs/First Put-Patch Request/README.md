    - overwrites the entire entity if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it doesn’t exist.

* PATCH
    - a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the key/value pairs within a resource.
    - it can overwrite a value of a key, and can create a new key/value pair if it doesn't already exist.
