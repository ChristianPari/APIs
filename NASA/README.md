This folder will contain all API projects that use just NASA APIs, below will be a short description of each folder/project.

* APOD
    - This was a in-class assignment which once functionallity was completed the CSS portion was to be finished afterwards to be styled by each individual.
    - I used the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API to give the user the ablitity to SELECT dates and have the dates be passed through the APIs ENDPOINT as PARAMETERS to retireve data corresponding to the selected date.
        - Data was used to change the webpage background to that APOD from the selected date.
        - Create a DIV filled with information about the image; title, date, and description
    - Can be re-ran via a BUTTON ELEMENT that allows the user to continue on to make another date selection.

* APOD_Insight
    - This was a class assigned project to create a UI of our own that would incorparate an API(s) from NASA's available APIs.
    - I used the APIs APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Insight (Mars Weather Service) to give the user the two ability's:
        - to cycle through the last 7 days via BUTTONs which would in turn change the webpage background IMAGE to the APOD IMAGE from that day.
        - to be able to get the Sol, Max Temperature, and Min Temperature on Mars.
    - User also has the option to change the background IMAGE to any days IMAGE via a BUTTON that when clicked will produce a new SELECT and close BUTTON where the user can scroll and SELECT a year, month and then day. The webpage background will then change to the APOD IMAGE from the SELECT day.
