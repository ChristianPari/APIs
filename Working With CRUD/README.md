* PUT n PATCH
    - With the use of the JSON Placeholder posts API I created a simple social media like webpage that allows a user to enter data into input boxes and change the data in the posts on the DOM and within the (fake) JSON posts API.

* PUT PATCH DELETE
    - With the use of the JSON Placeholder posts API I created a webpage that displays a users set of posts (10 users total; switch between posts via buttons) and the user can delete a post (from DOM and (fake) display), or edit the posts (if they change all the fields then a PUT request is made, otherwise a PATCH).
